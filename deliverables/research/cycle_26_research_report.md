# Research Report: Technical Debt System

This document outlines the plan to implement a technical debt system that allows overriding validation failures.

The implementation will involve the following steps:

1. The `_validate_stage` method in `src/dw6/state_manager.py` will be modified to handle test failures. It will check for a new `--with-tech-debt` flag.
2. A `--with-tech-debt` flag will be added to the `approve` command in `src/dw6/main.py`.
3. When the `--with-tech-debt` flag is used, the `Validator` will log the failing tests to `logs/technical_debt.log` instead of blocking the approval.
4. The `approve` command will be updated to pass the `--with-tech-debt` flag to the `WorkflowManager`.
