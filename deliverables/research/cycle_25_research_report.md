# Research Report: Migrate to New Repository

This document outlines the plan to migrate the existing codebase to a new, official GitHub repository named `windsurf-development-workflow`.

The migration will be performed in the following steps:

1.  A new, public GitHub repository named `windsurf-development-workflow` will be created using the GitHub API.
2.  The local git repository's remote URL will be updated to point to the new repository.
3.  All existing code, branches, and tags will be pushed to the new remote repository to complete the migration.
