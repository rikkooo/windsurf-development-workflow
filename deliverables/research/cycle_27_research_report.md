# Research Report: MCP Server Dashboard

This document outlines the plan to implement an MCP Server Dashboard to visualize the DW6 workflow state.

The implementation will involve the following steps:

1. A new HTML file, `src/dw6/dashboard.html`, will be created to serve as the user interface for the dashboard.
2. A new endpoint, `/dashboard`, will be added to `src/dw6/mcp_server.py` to serve the `dashboard.html` file.
3. The `dashboard.html` file will use JavaScript to fetch data from the existing MCP server endpoints (`/state`, `/git`, `/requirements`, `/tech-debt`) and display it in a user-friendly format.
